Our group did a mixed amount of pair, group programming, and individual coding.

## User Stories
- Users are able to sign up and login.
- Users (logged in or out) can search and view movie details, likes, and comments.
- Only logged in Users are able to comment and like movies.
- A logged in User likes a movie and it's added to a personal favorite list.

## Technology Used
>Primary communication methods used for this team: Slack, Zoom, and Trello. We kept track of the project using Trello and a kanban method.
We frequently maintained contact on Zoom during the main chunk of our coding time. Our group stayed in regular communication and updated on various schedule changes through a slack group chat.

##Feature Walkthroughs

>We wanted our site functionality to be available to both a logged in user and one who has yet to sign up. While some functionality needed to be limited to only logged in users, the primary search and view is not. If a user wants to make a comment on a movie they need to first sign up and log in. Then they can view a movie card, make comments, like, or edit it. A user may only edit or delete their own comments. Liking a movie will both increase the like value for that movie and add the movie to that user's personal list of liked movies.

>An additional feature we designed was to have a section to show the top movies based on highest number of likes. This was a challenge and came with an issue of promises and speed. It required us to learn about async / await functions. Which allowed us to solve our problem.
